// Legacy Tape — BLE pairing receiver.
//
// Advertises a BLE service that the iOS app discovers via the QR code's
// hardware_id. App writes a JSON credentials payload to the pair characteristic;
// device validates the token, stores SSID/PW/account in NVS, attempts WiFi
// connection, and notifies status bytes back to the app.
//
// See pairing.h for UUIDs + status byte constants.
